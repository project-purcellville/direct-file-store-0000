## Organization

The binaries in this repository are organized by directory based on build version and source.
This structure is crucial for the corpus test suite in the `angr` pipeline, which runs smaller
subset tests based on the directory structure. If any major directory structure changes occur
in this repository, please update the GitHub Action variables in the `angr` pipeline accordingly.

#### Retrieve Corpus Binary File

Code examples are provided below on how to download files from the GitHub release with curl, Python, and the GitHub CLI (gh).

##### Using curl directly with raw.githubusercontent:

```shell
$ file=cgc-challenges/linux-build/challenges/3D_Image_Toolkit/3D_Image_Toolkit
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/project-purcellville/direct-file-store-0000/main/$file --output out_file

##### Using a python library

```python
import requests

file = "cgc-challenges/linux-build/challenges/3D_Image_Toolkit/3D_Image_Toolkit"
url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/project-purcellville/direct-file-store-0000/main/{file}"
response = requests.get(url)
with open("out_file", "wb") as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

##### Using the gh CLI

```shell
gh api repos/project-purcellville/direct-file-store-0000/contents/cgc-challenges/linux-build/challenges/3D_Image_Toolkit/3D_Image_Toolkit --jq '.download_url' | xargs curl -L -o out_file
